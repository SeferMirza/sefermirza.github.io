Features are built-in behaviours that can be customized through their
configurers. Small features can be named as _Configuration_ or _Option_. When
they only configure an existing behaviour, such as `DatabaseConfiguration`, it
is a _Configuration_. When they provide nothing to configure other than
enable/disable, such as `UtcOption`, it is an _Option_.
