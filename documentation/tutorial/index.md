This is a tutorial that aims to help you to understand how to write a backend
using Gazel. Before you begin, you need to create an empty solution.

You may download an [empty solution][] to start right away. Once you open this
solution, directory structure should look like this:

```
Inventiv.Sample
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Inventiv.Sample.App.Rest
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Inventiv.Sample.App.Service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Inventiv.Sample.Module.Todo
â””â”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ Inventiv.Sample.Test.Todo
```

If you want to create an empty solution on your own, have a look at below
pages;

- [Create a solution](/setup#create-a-solution)
- [Add a module](/setup#add-a-module)

Basically, you will need to create a new solution named `Inventiv.Sample` and
add a new business module named `Inventiv.Sample.Module.Todo`.

Now that you have done this, you are ready to get started ðŸš€
